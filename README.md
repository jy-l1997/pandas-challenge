Module 4 Challenge: Pandas

I took datasets regarding different high schools in a school district and their students and merged them. I used that, and occasionally the original dataframes, to aggregate data about per student spending, average reading/math scores, pass rates (reading, math, and overall), school size, and breakdwon by grade level. I used those dataframes to compare how student performance (which I measured by overall pass % per school) was affected by different metrics. I found that whether a school is a charter school vs a district school is incredibly important in that.

Thanks to Shreha from AskBCS for helping me figure out how to make the per_school_summary dataframe which I then used to make my other dataframs, and StackOverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75808415/why-am-i-getting-typeerror-not-supported-between-instances-of-int-and-st) for helping fix an input error with school_spending_df
